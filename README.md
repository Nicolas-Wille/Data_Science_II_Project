# Data Science II Project: Predicting Future Crop Yields

## Authors: Nicolas Wille & Jasmina Djordjevic

### Abstract: 

This project aims at using climate data to predict future crop production volumes. This is important research to carry out, as we know that there has been a large population growth and that this growth is predicted to continue. In fact, the UN predicts that by 2050, there will be 9.7 billion people in the world, which is approximately a 25% increase from the current worldwide population (2022). This increase is exponential and comes with many different challenges. The one we are mainly concerned with in this project is: the future of agriculture and food production. With so many more people on the planet to feed, and more economic prosperity leading to a shift in diets, agricultural yields will need to astoundingly surpass historical levels, merely to see the population survive. In this paper, we will try to better understand the links between climate and crop production to forecast the productivity of different geographical areas, with a focus on European countries, and try to identify the most resilient lands and the most promising areas for future food production. Furthermore, we have developed an interactive tool that allows the user to enter their location and returns the predicted agricultural production in the year 2050 in their area, using our predictor.
